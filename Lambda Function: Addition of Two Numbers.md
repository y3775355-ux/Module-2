# Lambda Function in Python: Addition of Two Numbers

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that defines a *lambda function* which takes two arguments a and b, and returns their sum.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Get two integer inputs from the user.
2. Use a *lambda function* to define a function f that returns a + b.
3. Call the function with the user inputs and print the result.

## 🧾 Program
```
i=int(input())
j=int(input())
z=int(input())

f = lambda a, b,c: a+b+c

print(f(i, j,z))
```

## Output

## Result

Thus,the Python program that defines a lambda function which takes two arguments a and b, and returns their sum is created successfully.
