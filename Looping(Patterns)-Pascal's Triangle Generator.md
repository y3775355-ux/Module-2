# ðŸ”º Looping(Patterns)-Pascal's Triangle Generator in Python

This project demonstrates a simple Python program to generate *Pascalâ€™s Triangle*, where the number of rows is provided by the user.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program that generates *Pascal's Triangle* using numbers. The number of rows is accepted from the user.

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Input the number of rows from the user.
3. Loop from 0 to the number of rows.
4. For each row:
   - Print appropriate spaces to shape the triangle.
   - Compute values using the formula:  
     \[
     C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
     \]
5. Print all rows of Pascalâ€™s Triangle.
6. End the program.

---

## ðŸ§ª Program
```
n=int(input())
for i in range(n):
    for k in range(n,i+1,-1):
        print(" ",end='')
        
    num=1
    for j in range(i+1):
        print(num,end=" ")
        num=num*(i-j)//(j+1)
    print()
```

## Sample Output
<img width="521" height="547" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36271a7d-2343-4609-b0b8-044d9c5391f7" />


## Result

Thus the python program to generate Pascals's triangle has beem executedÂ successfully.
